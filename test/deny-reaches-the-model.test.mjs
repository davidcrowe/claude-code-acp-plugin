// gatewaystack-connect#692/#627: a deny should redirect the agent, not stop it.
//
// Two failures, both fixed here. First, the reason never reached the model:
// Claude Code reads hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason into the
// blocking error the model sees (hooks.ts:598-610), while systemMessage goes
// to the human. The cloud path set only systemMessage, so every ACP deny
// arrived as the bare fallback "Hook PreToolUse:<tool> denied this tool" —
// indistinguishable from a harness bug, and impossible to re-plan on.
//
// Second, nothing told the agent what to do next. A denied call is one
// refused operation, not a refused task, and a capability an agent thinks it
// should have is proposable. Floors are the exception: they cannot be allowed
// by policy or approval, so offering the proposal flow there would send the
// agent to file something no human can approve.
